Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first. 
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. 
Example
[1,3,4] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4]. 
Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are valid subsequences of the array.
